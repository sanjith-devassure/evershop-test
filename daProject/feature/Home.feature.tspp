<div style="font-size: inherit;">FR1: User Interface\r\n:\r\n\r\nThe user interface should embody the 'Evershop' brand with a consistent color palette, typography, and imagery that reinforces brand recognition.\r\nLegibility is paramount; thus, text and background contrasts should adhere to the minimum standards for visibility.\r\nAll interactive elements, including buttons, links, and form controls, must have a distinct hover state to inform the user that the item is actionable.\r\nThe layout should prioritize the most important information and actions to guide the user's journey through the site.\r\nFR2: Navigation Menu\r\n:\r\n\r\nThe navigation menu should be ever-present at the top of the viewport, offering immediate access to all major categories and user functionalities.\r\nSub-categories should expand from the main categories in a drop-down menu, providing quick navigation without cluttering the primary view.\r\nOn smaller screens, the navigation should convert into a hamburger menu to maximize screen real estate while remaining user-friendly.\r\nFR3: Promotional Banner\r\n:\r\n\r\nThe promotional banner acts as a dynamic billboard, showcasing the latest deals or featured products, which should rotate automatically at a set interval to capture attention without overwhelming the user.\r\nUsers should have the ability to control the rotation, either pausing on a preferred promotion or navigating to previous or next items.\r\nBanners must be fed from a content management system, allowing non-technical staff to update promotions as needed without deploying code changes.\r\nFR4: Product Highlights\r\n:\r\n\r\nHighlighted sections should utilize high-quality imagery relevant to the collection and include a concise description outlining the unique features and benefits of the collection.\r\nThe descriptions should be compelling, encouraging users to explore the collection further.\r\nEach section must contain a clearly labeled call-to-action button that, when clicked, directs the user to a product listing page filtered to show only the items from the selected collection.\r\nFR5: Featured Products Section\r\n:\r\n\r\nThe featured products should be curated to showcase new arrivals, best-sellers, or items on promotion.\r\nThe backend must provide an interface for the e-commerce manager to select and update these featured products easily.\r\nEach product must have a high-definition image, price, and name displayed, with a hover-triggered quick view option that provides a brief description and the option to add the product directly to the shopping cart.\r\nFR6: Shopping Cart Functionality\r\n:\r\n\r\nThe shopping cart icon should indicate the number of items currently in the cart and, when hovered over or clicked, should display a preview of the cart's contents.\r\nThe cart preview should allow users to see product details, remove items, or adjust quantities right from the dropdown, streamlining the shopping experience.\r\nFR7: User Account Access\r\n:\r\n\r\nThe account access should provide a quick link to user profile information, order history, and wishlist or saved items.\r\nThe login process should be expedited with the option for users to sign in using their social media accounts, subject to the appropriate privacy and data-handling protocols.\r\nFR8: Search Functionality\r\n:\r\n\r\nThe search bar should be prominently placed and designed for ease of use, allowing users to start typing and immediately see suggested results with images, price information, and a short description.\r\nPredictive text and auto-complete functionality should be implemented to help users find products faster.\r\nFR9: Footer\r\n:\r\n\r\nThe footer is an important navigation aid and should contain links to all secondary pages such as 'About Us', 'FAQ', 'Contact', 'Privacy Policy', and 'Terms of Service'.\r\nIt should also provide users the option to sign up for a newsletter and follow 'Evershop' on various social media platforms, fostering community engagement.\r\nFR10: Accessibility and Performance\r\n:\r\n\r\nThe website must comply with WCAG 2.1 guidelines to ensure that content is accessible to a broader audience, including those with disabilities.\r\nTechniques such as lazy loading for off-screen images and asynchronous loading for scripts should be used to ensure that the site loads quickly, providing a smooth user experience even on slower internet connections.<br></div>
