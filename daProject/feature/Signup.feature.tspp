<div style="font-size: inherit;">2.1 User Interface\r\nFR1: Signup Form\r\n\r\nThe signup form must be the central element of the page to immediately attract user attention upon page load.\r\nIt should contain three input fields: one for the full name of the user, one for the email address, and one for the password the user wishes to create.\r\nPlaceholder text in each field should be grayed out and disappear when the user begins typing.\r\nThe Full Name field should accept alphabetic characters and basic punctuation (e.g., hyphens, apostrophes).\r\nThe Email field should accept text input and include validation to ensure the format matches standard email patterns (e.g., user@example.com).\r\nThe Password field should be a password-type input that obscures text entered by the user for security.\r\nFR2: Signup Button\r\n\r\nA button labeled 'SIGN UP' shall be placed directly below the Password field to initiate the registration process.\r\nThe button must be styled in a way that makes it clear it is the next step after filling out the form (e.g., using a contrasting color).\r\nThe 'SIGN UP' button will be inactive and visually distinct (e.g., grayed out) until all input fields have valid entries.\r\nFR3: Navigation to Login\r\n\r\nDirectly beneath the 'SIGN UP' button, a text link stating 'Already have an account? Login' shall be provided to navigate existing users to the login page.\r\nSelecting this link should immediately take the user to the login page without requiring a separate confirmation step.\r\n2.2 Functionality\r\nFR4: Data Validation\r\n\r\nInput validation must occur on the client side before the form is submitted to ensure that all fields are filled out correctly.\r\nThe Full Name field must be checked to ensure it is not left blank and does not contain invalid characters or numbers.\r\nThe Email field shall use a regular expression to validate the email format.\r\nThe Password field must enforce a predefined set of rules for password complexity (e.g., minimum 8 characters, at least one number, one uppercase letter, and one special character).\r\nFR5: Account Creation\r\n\r\nThe system shall check for the existence of the entered email in the database to prevent duplicate account creation.\r\nIf the email is not found in the database, the system shall create a new account entry.\r\nA confirmation or error message shall be displayed depending on the success of the account creation process.\r\nFR6: Email Verification\r\n\r\nThe system shall send a verification email to the userâ€™s entered email address upon successful account creation.\r\nThe verification email shall include a unique link that the user must click to verify their account.\r\nThe user's account shall be marked as verified in the database once they follow the verification link.\r\nFR7: Session Initiation\r\n\r\nAfter the account is verified, users may be automatically signed in and redirected to a welcome page or user dashboard, or they may be prompted to sign in through the login page, based on the designed user flow.\r\n2.3 Security\r\nFR8: Password Handling\r\n\r\nPasswords shall be securely hashed using a strong cryptographic function (e.g., SHA-256) before being transmitted over the network.\r\nThe server shall store only the hashed version of the password in the database.\r\n2.4 Accessibility\r\nFR9: Accessibility Compliance\r\n\r\nForm fields shall include 'label' tags that are associated with the input fields to ensure screen readers can announce form elements correctly.\r\nError messages and instructions shall be marked with ARIA roles where applicable to ensure they are conveyed to users of assistive technologies.\r\n2.5 Error Handling\r\nFR10: User Feedback\r\n\r\nImmediate, inline feedback shall be provided for validation errors in each field, so users can correct them before submitting the form.\r\nUpon submission, if errors occur (e.g., network issues, duplicate email), a user-friendly message explaining the problem and suggested actions shall be displayed.\r\n2.6 Performance\r\nFR11: System Performance\r\n\r\nThe account creation process shall be designed to complete within 5 seconds, assuming standard network conditions and server response times.<br></div>
